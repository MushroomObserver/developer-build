developer-build
===============

Information and scripts for creating a full Mushroom Observer development environment from scratch using VirtualBox and Vagrant/Chef and then packaging for developer-startup.


Create working environment
--------------------------
- Install VirtualBox

- Install git (on Mac I've found the GitHub GUI is very useful)

- Get ruby 1.9.3 working
  There are three different approaches for this documented here: http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
  Personally I use RVM since it gives me the flexibility to leave the default ruby installed by MacOS alone and create different ruby environments.  However, this may be overkill for some and RVM forces you to use the Bash shell to really take advantage of it.  In most cases you will need to have a working version of gcc 4.2 or later working to get ruby 1.9.3 installed.
  To install RVM on my Mac under Mountain Lion I had to do the following:
  - Install gcc 4.2 compiler for rvm/ruby (on Mac that currently involves installing Xcode from the App Store including the Command Line Tools (Preferences => Downloads and install 'Command Line Tools'))
  - Install just rvm: \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
  - Install Homebrew: ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
  - Run 'rvm requirements' to get a list of brew requirements to get rvm configured with Ruby 1.9.3.
    For me, this meant: brew update; brew tap homebrew/dupes; brew install autoconf automake apple-gcc42 libtool pkg-config openssl readline libyaml sqlite libxml2 libxslt libksba
  - Now install ruby using RVM: \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby [Perhaps 'rvm install 1.9.3' would work just as well]
  - Finally, open a new shell and check the version of ruby with 'ruby --version'.  You should get something like: ruby 1.9.3p194 (2012-04-20 revision 35410) [x86_64-darwin11.3.0]

- Get the developer-build Git project: % git clone https://github.com/MushroomObserver/developer-build.git

- Go into the resulting directory: % cd developer-build

- If you have bash installed, run the startup script: % ./startup
  Otherwise, just run the commands in this file from any command-line tool.

- Wait for a while... (5m3.661s on my Mac)

- Test the new machine: % vagrant ssh
  On Windows machines this may require installing an ssh client like Putty.  Attempting to run 'vagrant ssh' will give you the parameters you need to give to Putty.
  You have been successful if the final output line is:
    vagrant@lucid32:~$ 

Assuming all of that was successful, you now have a running virtual machine with the MO source code installed, an instance of MySQL and all the goodies to successfully run all the tests and startup a local server (see below).  You access the new machine by being in the developer-build directory and running 'vagrant ssh' or through Putty.  The new instance of MySQL can be accessed with usernames/passwords mo/mo or root/root.

To run the tests in the new environment
---------------------------------------
- Go to vagrant machine ('vagrant ssh' or through Putty)

- $ cd /vagrant/mushroom-observer

- $ script/run_tests

Start web server
----------------
- Go to vagrant machine ('vagrant ssh' or through Putty)

- $ cd /vagrant/mushroom-observer

- $ script/server

- Go to http://localhost:3000 in a browser

Packaging the server
--------------------
- $ vagrant package --vagrantfile mo-dev.pkg
- scp package.box cdmr@digitalmycology.com:images.digitalmycology.com/mo-dev.box

Edit code
---------
In your developer-build directory there will be a 'mushroom-observer' directory.  This is a 'shared folder' which is the same as /vagrant/mushroom-observer on the VM.  You can change code here on either machine and it will be picked up by the server on the VM.

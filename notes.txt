Tried adding RVM with:
  chef.add_recipe("rvm::system") based on 'recipe[rvm::system]' from https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rvm#readme
  Then ran: vagrant provision
  Got: ERROR:  Could not find a valid gem 'chef' (>= 0) in any repository...
	However when I backed out that line and re-ran vagrant I now get that error as well
	Realized I probably need to run the library again, so add "cookbook 'rvm'" to the Cheffile, but no joy.
	Figured out it's probably getting the wrong RVM cookbook.
	Found http://blog.base2.io/2012/05/01/vagrants-and-chefs-and-librarians-oh-my.  Added the magic from there.
	Librarian seems to get the right thing now, but 'vagrant provision' fails with a "Illformed requirement".
	Not sure how to proceed.  Did note that fnichol RVM Git repo has a version 0.9.0 released May 15, 2012, but the blog entry explicitly uses the version before that (0.8.6) and is dated May 1, 2012.
